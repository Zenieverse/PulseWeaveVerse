PulseWeaveVerse 🧵🌍

Prototype Demo: https://poe.com/PulseWeaveVerse

Project Overview
PulseWeaveVerse is a futuristic data intelligence dashboard that visualizes the relationship between human sentiment and infrastructure performance across global regions.

Three Modes:

SENSE Mode - Generative data art visualization with particle systems, flowing waves, and real-time metric displays
DECIDE Mode - Operational dashboard with KPI cards, time-series charts, correlation matrix, and alert system
EXPLORE Mode - Interactive 3D globe (Three.js) showing regional data with selectable data layers
Key Features
Feature	Description
Real-time Data Simulation	DataFabric system simulates live sentiment, latency, traffic, and uptime metrics
Generative Art Canvas	Particle system and wave animations that respond to data values
Correlation Matrix	Interactive 4x4 matrix showing metric correlations with color-coded cells
3D Globe	Three.js-powered interactive globe with regional markers and pulse animations
AI Insights	Integrates with Poe API (GPT-5.1) for intelligent data analysis, with local fallback
Responsive Design	Adapts to mobile/tablet with collapsible panels and reorganized grid
Dark Mode	Full dark theme with system preference detection
Accessibility	ARIA labels, keyboard navigation (Alt+1/2/3), focus states
Tech Stack
HTML5/CSS3 - Semantic markup with CSS Grid/Flexbox
Vanilla JavaScript - No framework dependencies
Three.js - 3D globe visualization
Google Fonts - JetBrains Mono (monospace) + Outfit (UI)
CSS Custom Properties - Theming with accent colors and transitions
File Details
Single file architecture: index.html (2,405 lines)

Lines 1-1106: CSS styles with dark mode support
Lines 1107-1362: HTML structure with all three modes
Lines 1364-2403: JavaScript modules (DataFabric, SenseMode, DecideMode, ExploreMode, AIEngine, App)
The application is fully self-contained and ready to run as a Poe Canvas App!

PulseWeaveVerse is a multi-modal data experience that weaves together human sentiment and machine infrastructure signals into a single living system—expressed as art, analytics, and immersive worlds.

It is built to demonstrate how unrelated data sources, when woven together, can reveal invisible global dynamics.

✨ What Is PulseWeaveVerse?

PulseWeaveVerse merges three experiences into one adaptive application:

Mode	Experience	Purpose
🎨 Sense	Generative data art	Feel global emotional + system states
🧭 Decide	Ops & risk dashboard	Act on sentiment-driven system risk
🌍 Explore	MR / VR globe	Navigate data spatially and immersively
All modes run on a shared data fabric, ensuring consistency while allowing radically different expressions.

🧠 Core Insight

Human emotion is an invisible load on digital infrastructure.
PulseWeaveVerse makes this load:

Visible as art
Measurable as risk
Navigable as a world
🧩 The Data Weave (Unrelated Sources)

Human Signal Layer

Global sentiment streams (social + news)
Emotion keyword trends
Sentiment volatility index
Machine Signal Layer

Cloud uptime & incident metrics
Network congestion & latency
Blockchain / compute stress indicators
The Magic

PulseWeaveVerse correlates these layers to reveal:

Emotional shockwaves before outages
Infrastructure strain during global events
Hidden feedback loops between people and systems
🎛️ Experience Modes

🎨 SENSE — Data-as-Art

Flowing threads and woven fibers
Color, motion, and tension driven by live data
No charts, no numbers — pure perception
Use cases:
Museums, installations, opening demos, ambient displays

🧭 DECIDE — Ops & Sentiment Risk

Sentiment volatility vs system stress
Correlation heatmaps
Predictive risk scoring
AI-generated explanations
Use cases:
SRE teams, platform ops, digital risk monitoring

🌍 EXPLORE — MR / VR Globe

3D Earth with emotional atmospheres
Infrastructure visualized as neural grids
Correlations as shockwaves and gravity wells
Use cases:
Strategy, education, immersive demos, future-facing storytelling
